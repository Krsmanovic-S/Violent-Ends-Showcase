This is a repository for showing some of the features that are implemented inside my private video game project. The game I am working on is a sci-fi top-down ARPG inspired by a game called 'The Ascent'.

# Shader Example

**Gathered experience**:

  • Working with the 'Time' node
  
  • Adjusting UV coordinates of textures
  
  • Multiplying/Adding different color channels
  
  • Working with floats, float2's and float3's
  
  • Using exposed parameters to control shaders via Mat Instances & Blueprints
  
  • Working with noise textures

**Gathered experience**:

  • Creatively solving all edge case problems with item pathing
  
  • Adding randomness to acieve a non-static look
  
  • Connecting inputs, blueprints and C++ together
  
  • Using vector math for tracing objects
  
  • Working with 'Timelines' and custom collision channels

# Ability Showcase

**Gathered experience**:

  • Connecting user input with UI and C++ code
  
  • Implementing timers in UMG to achieve the 'cooldown' effect
  
  • Using vector math to calculate the spawn location and desired rotation of the ability
 
# UMG UI Development

**Gathered experience**:

  • Using almost every UMG container to form a cohesive menu
  
  • Working with the DPI Scale and optimizing UI with it
  
  • Working with multicast delegates in C++
  
  • Using replicated variables to avoid unnecessary casting
  
  • Optimizing update methods to only occur when needed
  
  • Implementing Drag & Drop and other mouse events
  
  • Adding UI animations to various elements
  
  • Translating a world position into a UV coordinate on a texture
  
  • Learning about dynamic materials and how they apply to UI

# AI Development

**Gathered experience**:

  • Working with Unreal's Behavior Trees, Blackboards and EQS systems
  
  • Writing custom tasks, decorators and queries in C++
  
  • Calculating the predicted rotation that is needed to hit a moving target
  
  • Working with 'Nav Meshes'
  
  • Implementing AI Perception and 'Generic Team ID'

# Reflection Vector Showcase
